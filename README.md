## Project Overview

CarpoolMusic is an iOS app designed to create a social music-sharing experience. Users can start a music session, invite friends to join, and listen together in real-time. By leveraging Apple Music and Spotify integrations, users have access to millions of songs and can control the playlist collaboratively, making every drive, gathering, or virtual hangout a synchronized musical journey.

## Features

- **Real-Time Music Sessions**: Host or join live music sessions to listen to songs together.
- **Cross-Platform Music Support**: Compatible with both Apple Music and Spotify.
- **Dynamic Playlists**: Easily add, reorder, or remove songs in real-time.
- **Remote and Local Syncing**: Enjoy music with friends nearby or from across the world.
- **Voting Mechanism**: Allow participants to vote on the next track.
- **Session Discovery**: Quickly find and join nearby sessions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design for seamless navigation and music control.

## Architecture

CarpoolMusic follows a modular and scalable architecture, utilizing best practices to ensure a clean and maintainable codebase. Hereâ€™s a high-level overview of the architecture:

- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: Ensures a clear separation between UI and business logic.
- **Network Layer**: Manages all network requests to fetch music data and sync playback states.
- **Dependency Injection**: Simplifies testing and reduces coupling between components.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Integrates WebSocket/HTTP for live music session updates.
  
### Key Components

1. **ViewModels**: Handles the logic of each screen, updates views with session data, and manages user interactions.
2. **Networking Layer**: Communicates with the backend (using REST and WebSocket protocols) to retrieve and send session data.
3. **Data Models**: Defines core entities like `User`, `Session`, and `Song`.
4. **Third-Party Integrations**: Manages the integration with Apple Music and Spotify SDKs for song playback and control.

## Technologies Used

- **Languages**: Swift
- **Frameworks**: SwiftUI, Combine, AVFoundation
- **Third-Party Libraries**: 
  - `Alamofire` - for networking
  - `Socket.IO` - for real-time session syncing
  - `SpotifySDK` - integration with Spotify
  - `MusicKit` - integration with Apple Music
- **APIs**: Apple Music API, Spotify API
- **Dependency Management**: Swift Package Manager
